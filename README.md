# OpenMP Dijkstra's Algorithm

This repository contains a parallel implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using OpenMP for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph.

## Overview

Dijkstra's algorithm is a classical algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This implementation parallelizes the algorithm using OpenMP to improve performance by utilizing multiple threads.

## Features

- Parallelized implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using OpenMP.
- Allows the user to specify the number of threads to utilize.
- Reads input graph from a text file.
- Computes the shortest paths from a specified source node to all other nodes in the graph.
